By scraping data from various job posting websites, the project offers valuable insights into job titles, salaries, locations, and key skills that are in high demand.

## Objectives
### Questions to answer using SQL queries:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

## Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and find valuable insights.
- **MS SQL Server:** The chosen database management system.
- **MS SQL Server Management Studio:** For database management and executing SQL queries.
